# Task Management REST API

A simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js for managing tasks. The API supports CRUD operations, input validation, error handling, filtering, sorting, and task prioritization using in-memory data storage.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks
- Input validation for task creation and updates
- Error handling for invalid requests
- Filter tasks by completion status
- Sort tasks by creation date
- Manage task priorities (low, medium, high)
- Retrieve tasks by priority level
- Modular project structure using Routes, Controllers, Middleware, and Data layers

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js

GET /tasks?completed=true&sort=desc
```

---

## Get Tasks By Priority

Retrieve tasks by priority level.

### High Priority

```http
GET /tasks/priority/high
```

### Medium Priority

```http
GET /tasks/priority/medium
```

### Low Priority

- No database is used in this project.
- The API is designed to demonstrate Express.js routing, validation, filtering, sorting, and controller-based architecture.
